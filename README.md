# Classification Comparisons of Supervised Learning Algorithms

## Description

A comparison of five different supervised machine learning algorithms across three datasets. Each algorithm was tested and cross validated with a range of different parameters using varying training and testing splits. For a detailed post analysis, please refer to the accompaniment [paper]().

## Datasets

* [Wilt Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wilt)
* [Mushroom Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/mushroom)
* [HTRU2 Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HTRU2)

All datasets were provided by the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)

## Instructions

Please make sure the following modules are installed:
* Pandas
* SKLearn

Be sure to 'Run All' at the start of the kernel.
